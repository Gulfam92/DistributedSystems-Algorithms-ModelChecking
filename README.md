# Project Description:
<p align= "Justify">
In this project, a decentralized consensus algorithm, BenOr is implemented using PlusCal and TLA+. BenOr protocol is a binary protocol which decides commit or abort for each instance. For more details about the algorithm, please refer the proof document in the following link
[BenOr Research paper link] (http://disi.unitn.it/~montreso/ds/syllabus/papers/AguileraToeug-CorrecnessBenOr.pdf). In this project, to test the specs for different scenarios and analyze what can go wrong in distributed set up, TLA+ model checker is used for the validation and model checking.
